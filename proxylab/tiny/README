Tiny Web server

This is the home directory for the Tiny server, a 200-line Web
server that we use in "15-213: Intro to Computer Systems" at Carnegie
Mellon University.  Tiny uses the GET method to serve static content
(text, HTML, GIF, and JPG files) out of ./ and to serve dynamic
content by running CGI programs out of ./cgi-bin. The default 
page is home.html (rather than index.html) so that we can view
the contents of the directory from a browser.

Tiny is neither secure nor complete, but it gives students an
idea of how a real Web server works. Use for instructional purposes only.

The code compiles and runs cleanly using gcc 2.95.3 
on a Linux 2.2.20 kernel.
